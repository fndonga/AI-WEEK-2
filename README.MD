# SDG 13 – Climate Action: Predicting CO₂ Emissions

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)** can contribute to **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 – Climate Action**.  
The goal is to **predict monthly CO₂ emissions** for cities based on environmental and industrial features. This can help policymakers plan interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change.

**Key Features:**
- Predict CO₂ emissions using **Random Forest Regressor** (supervised learning)
- Visualize feature correlations with CO₂ emissions
- Evaluate model performance using **MAE, MSE, and R² score**
- Include ethical considerations for fairness and sustainability

## Dataset
- Simulated dataset for demonstration purposes  
- Features:
  - `Month` – Month of the year (1-12)
  - `Temperature` – Average temperature in Celsius
  - `Industry_Index` – Industrial activity index
  - `Vehicle_Count` – Number of vehicles in the city
- Target:
  - `CO2_Emissions` – Predicted CO₂ emissions

*Note: In a real project, replace with datasets from [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/), [UN SDG Database](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/), or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).*
